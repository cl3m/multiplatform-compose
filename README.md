:warning:  This PoC compile on iOS and Android but I've remove some functionality because Compose changed too much since I started it. I will update it using the compose compiler when it will be possible. There are some hope on the way :
- [Redwood Compose](https://github.com/cashapp/redwood) by Cash App. [Native UI with multiplatform Compose](https://jakewharton.com/native-ui-with-multiplatform-compose/). Use the compose compiler and native iOS component. 
- [Compose Multiplatform by JetBrains](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb) started native support via Skia ([Skiko](https://github.com/JetBrains/skiko)), you can have a look at the [sample](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/experimental/examples/falling-balls-mpp) but it is still very early. Some of the demos in this repo works but there is still many broken functionality. Touchlab made a demo for [Droidcon NYC App](https://touchlab.co/droidcon-nyc-ios-app-with-compose/) It will use the compose compiler but not native component.  
- [Platform-Kit by IceRock](https://github.com/Alex009/compose-jb/tree/platform-kit-sample/examples/common-platform-uikit) based on Compose Multiplatform by JetBrains, add support via UIKit, thus use the compose compiler and native iOS component.  

I've started to experiment with Compose Native, you can have a look at https://github.com/cl3m/kmp-redux/tree/skiko on iOS two views are SwiftUI and two views are Compose (ComposeSpaceView & ComposeCounterView) and share the same store.

![Demos](https://github.com/cl3m/multiplatform-compose/blob/compose-jb/screenshots/Demos.png?raw=true)

#### AsyncImage

The image composable allow url loading

```kotlin
AsyncImage(url = "https://loremflickr.com/320/240/ocean", modifier = Modifier.preferredSize(200.dp))
```

#### SafeArea

SafeArea.current context with PaddingValues.


## Troubleshooting

### e: java.lang.IllegalStateException: No file for ***

Compose function and context has to be internal and not exposed to iOS module.

## Contributing

All development (both new features and bug fixes) is performed in the `develop` branch. This way `master` always contains the sources of the most recently released version. Use git-flow if possible.

You can start a PR with incomplete implementation to shows what you are working on. Please send PRs with bug fixes or new features to the `develop` branch. Documentation fixes in the markdown files are an exception to this rule. They are updated directly in `master`.

The `develop` branch is pushed to `master` on release.
