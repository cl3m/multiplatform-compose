The image composable allow url loading

```kotlin

```

#### SafeArea

## Troubleshooting

### e: java.lang.IllegalStateException: No file for ***

Compose function and CompositonLocal have to be internal and not exposed to iOS module.

## Alternatives

- [Compose Multiplatform by JetBrains](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb) started native support via Skia ([Skiko](https://github.com/JetBrains/skiko)), you can have a look at the [sample](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/experimental/examples/falling-balls-mpp). Touchlab made a demo for [Droidcon NYC App](https://touchlab.co/droidcon-nyc-ios-app-with-compose/) It will use the compose compiler but not native component.  

- [Redwood Compose](https://github.com/cashapp/redwood) by Cash App. [Native UI with multiplatform Compose](https://jakewharton.com/native-ui-with-multiplatform-compose/). Use the compose compiler and native iOS component. 

- [Platform-Kit by IceRock](https://github.com/Alex009/compose-jb/tree/platform-kit-sample/examples/common-platform-uikit) based on Compose Multiplatform by JetBrains, add support via UIKit, thus use the compose compiler and native iOS component.  

- [multiplatform-compose](https://github.com/cl3m/multiplatform-compose/tree/yoga) This original repo, an experiment with native view and yoga for layout. You can also have a look at [kmp-redux](https://github.com/cl3m/kmp-redux/tree/skiko) that show Compose integration with SwiftUI.
